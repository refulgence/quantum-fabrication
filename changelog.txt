---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.5.2
Date: 29.12.2024
  Optimizations:
    - Improved performance of automatic rechecks for lost item request proxies.
      The mod will no longer cause sharp UPS drops every ~4 seconds that become sharper the bigger the factory grows.
      But the bigger your factory gets the less frequent updates will become. In endgame it could take about 30-45 seconds between you placing ghost modules in a building and these modules getting inserted. You can still force instant updates via either GUI -> Preferences -> Find lost item request proxies or console command /qf_update_module_requests if you don't want to wait.
      The preference option "Automatically recheck for lost item request proxies" has been removed.
      Further optimizations may or may not come in the future.

    - Fixed a crash caused by modded recipes that produce research progress instead of items or fluids.

Note: the mod might no longer use player's inventory at all while in remote view. It might've worked before, but it just doesn't work now. Put things inside the Storage.
