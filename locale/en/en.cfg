digitizer-chest=Digitizing chest
dedigitizer-reactor=Dedigitizing reactor

[item-description]
digitizer-chest=Digitizes items and fluids to store them in a bottomless digital inventory.\nCan be controlled via circuits: send [virtual-signal=signal-L] to set intake limit and [virtual-signal=signal-D] to enable/disable decrafting (any values above 0 will enable it, any values below 0 will disable it, no signal or 0 will use chest settings)
dedigitizer-reactor=Utilizes nuclear energy to bring stored items back to the analog world!
qf-storage-reader=Outputs Quantum storage as signals.\nOptional: set [virtual-signal=signal-S] to a storage index you want to get

[mod-setting-description]
qf-allow-decrafting=If checked, then putting buildings in Quantum Storage will automatically decraft them into their ingredients
qf-enable-auto-repair=If checked the mod will automatically repair building by using stored repair packs shortly after the combat is over. This setting will not affect reconstruction of destroyed buildings.\nWARNING - this might impact performance late game when you are constantly attacked by biters.
qf-enable-space-transfer=If checked the mod will be fulfilling space platform's requests from the Storage. Requires a rocket silo on the surface; crafts and consumes rocket parts.
qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=If checked then directly mining buildings (right clicking them) will send them to the Storage; otherwise they'll be placed in your inventory like expected from vanilla.\nWarning - if checked it breaks the Undo functionality for buildings you mine.
qf-reactor-transfer-multi=Default rates are 4 items / 80 fluid per second.\nFor example, setting this to 10 would make reactors transfer 40 items / 800 fluid per second
qf-reactor-free-transfer=If checked then Dedigitizing reactor will no longer require heating to transfer items / fluids
qf-use-player-inventory=If unchecked then the mod will ignore player's inventory for all purposes (such as construction, fabrication, deconstruction, item requests, etc)
qf-allow-pulling-out=If unchecked then you won't be able to manually take items from the Storage to your inventory
qf-deconstruct-non-buildables=This affects everything that's cannot be blueprinted, so trees, rocks, items on the ground, etc.
qf-super-digitizing-chests=If checked then Digitizing chests will be able to instantly fetch requested items from the Storage for no cost.\nSimply send item/fluid signals to the chest. Only one fluid is allowed per chest, the highest signal value will be used.\nSpecial signals are:\nQuality signals to set quality to regular item signals\n[virtual-signal=signal-S] to specify Storage index from which items are fetched\n[virtual-signal=signal-F] to set Fixed quantity of items that would be pulled (useful in certain cases)
qf-chests-processed-per-second=High values = more frequent updates = higher performance impact
