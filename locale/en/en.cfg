qf-fabricator-gui-toggle=Open Quantum Fabricator's inventory

[shortcut-name]
qf-fabricator-gui=Open Quantum Fabricator GUI
qf-fabricator-enable=Toggle Quantum Fabricator\nAffects construction, deconstruction, upgrading and repairs\nNo effect on deconstruction of trees/rocks/cliffs

[mod-setting-name]
qf-allow-decrafting=Enable decrafting?
qf-enable-auto-repair=Enable auto repair?
qf-enable-space-transfer=Enable space transfer?
qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=Send directly mined buildings to the Storage
qf-reactor-transfer-multi=Dedigitizing reactor: transfer rate multiplier
qf-reactor-free-transfer=Dedigitizing reactor: free transfer
qf-use-player-inventory=Consider player's inventory?
qf-allow-pulling-out=Allow manually remove items from the Storage?

[mod-setting-description]
qf-allow-decrafting=If checked, then putting buildings in Quantum Storage will automatically decraft them into their ingredients
qf-enable-auto-repair=If checked the mod will automatically repair building by using stored repair packs shortly after the combat is over. This setting will not affect reconstruction of destroyed buildings.\nWARNING - this might impact performance late game when you are constantly attacked by biters.
qf-enable-space-transfer=If checked the mod will be fulfilling space platform's requests from the Storage. Requires a rocket silo on the surface; crafts and consumes rocket parts.
qf-direct-mining-puts-in-storage=If checked then directly mining buildings (right clicking them) will send them to the Storage; otherwise they'll be placed in your inventory like expected from vanilla.\nWarning - if checked it breaks the Undo functionality for buildings you mine.
qf-reactor-transfer-multi=Default rates are 4 items / 80 fluid per second.\nFor example, setting this to 10 would make reactors transfer 40 items / 800 fluid per second
qf-reactor-free-transfer=If checked then Dedigitizing reactor will no longer require heating to transfer items / fluids
qf-use-player-inventory=If unchecked then the mod will ignore player's inventory for all purposes (such as construction, fabrication, deconstruction, item requests, etc)
qf-allow-pulling-out=If unchecked then you won't be able to manually take items from the Storage to your inventory
